# Cancer-Prediction

This project was introduced as one of kaggle problems.So firstly they had provided us with the training data only, so to test my 
models i just did 70-30 split for train and text data.So whole of my project is modeled on the basis of train data only.As the data 
was imbalanced so i had to do split on every class label.

The data provided could be found on kaggle link:https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment#evaluation

In this project i have tried to do full exploratory data analysis on gene,variaion and text provided as well as i tried to 
implement some of the machine learning algorithms after preprocessing text data.The maximum accuracy i got is 43%.
